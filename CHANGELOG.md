# Changelog
## v2.2.0 (unreleased)
- **BREAKING** Moved the package from `org.jraf.android.androidwearcolorpicker.app` to `org.jraf.android.androidwearcolorpicker`.
The old package name was a mistake, sorry about it. 
- New API to specify the colors to display instead of automatically compute them
- Improved enter/exit animations
- Added a sample app

## v2.1.0 (2019-02-03)
- Use the old color param to scroll to it (thanks to @TpmKranz)
